# Generative AI Software Applications Demo

This repository contains code from a demo showcasing how to use generative AI to create software applications. The code is organized into directories, each showcasing how to create an API with Java, an API with Python, and a front-end app with React

During the demo we used both Github Copilot Chat and ChatGPT v4.0. Unfortunately, lost the original conversation with Copilot and couldn't share all the prompts :S.
